To do:
- right wheel dae seperate for pioneer
- Sensor additions

Notes:
- Chasis visual should have origin at its center.
- config file must have prefix of robot name followed by config.urdf.xacro eg : husky_config.urdf.xacro
- Meshes should be under the corresponding folder with the robot name : chasis.dae, left_wheel.dae and right_wheel.dae
- Further addition of meshes to the chasis or so includes more work
